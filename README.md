Give your website a sense of humor with lol.js!

Too often websites are serious places and this is bad for retention, customer acquisition, and even leads to visitor mortalities.
Tired of poor click-throughs? Is spending countless hours pouring over gigabytes of analytics leading nowhere?
Now you can change this!
You can organically grow your user base with just a few simple lines of javascript code.

Instructions:

* Upload lol.js, and loljs_audio to your server. Make sure this is in the same directory as the page you wish to lol.

* Then add the following to your html enabled internet site, or web page:
- <code> < script src="loljs.js" > < /script > </code> but remove the spaces, lol

Features Include:

* Ticklish page.
* Scrollbars lol out loud.
* Written content is, for the most part, lol enhanced.

Troubleshooting Tips & Common Issues:

* Make sure you upload the right files.
* Make sure you uploaded the right files to your server (and not someone else's).
* You must have a sense of humor pre-installed. If you do not have one this is not my problem and I cannot help you with this.
* If you followed the instructions carefully, and your page still does not laugh (this is the primary function of lol.js), you can also laugh for it. You do not necessarily need the audio to play, as you are perfectly equipped to make the same noise yourself.
